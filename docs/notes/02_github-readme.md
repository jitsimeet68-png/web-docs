# Open WebUI GitHub README

## Summary
The project README documents high-level features, installation paths, and the
extensibility philosophy behind Open WebUI. It calls out pluggable tools and
pipe-based workflows that allow developers to orchestrate code generation and
execution contexts. The README also links to tutorial and reference material for
extending the platform.

## Key Points
- Lists first-class feature pillars (Tools, Functions, Pipes, Actions, Filters) and
  indicates their purpose in the overall user workflow.
- Provides repository structure and configuration instructions necessary to enable
  custom tool modules and pipeline integrations when developing locally.
- Highlights community resources and contribution guidelines that explain how to
  package and share extensions.

## Key Terms
- **Feature pillars** — the official categories of extensibility surface area.
- **Self-host deployment** — local or server setups enabling advanced customization.
- **Extension packaging** — the process for bundling tools/pipes/actions into sharable
  components.

## Implementation Notes
- Mirror README terminology in knowledge base indexes to maintain alignment with the
  open source project language.
- Track README anchor links for quick cross-referencing inside `docs/index.md`.
