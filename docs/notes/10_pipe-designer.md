# Pipe Designer Walkthrough

## Summary
The designer walkthrough demonstrates constructing pipelines in the UI. It
covers dragging nodes onto the canvas, configuring tool/function properties,
connecting branches, and testing runs. The guide also includes collaboration and
versioning tips for sharing pipes.

## Key Points
- Introduces UI concepts such as the node palette, canvas, inspector, and run
  console.
- Shows how to configure inputs, map outputs between nodes, and apply filters or
  transformations without editing code.
- Describes debugging features: step-by-step execution, variable inspection, and
  run history.

## Key Terms
- **Inspector panel** — UI area for editing node parameters.
- **Run console** — output viewer showing execution logs and intermediate data.
- **Shared pipe** — saved pipeline that can be reused by team members.

## Implementation Notes
- Capture annotated screenshots (when possible) for training materials to reduce
  onboarding time for pipeline authors.
- Reflect UI terminology in knowledge base taxonomy to align with the designer.
