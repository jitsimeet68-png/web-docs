# Open WebUI Documentation Portal

## Summary
The documentation portal explains the scope of Open WebUI, highlights its modular
architecture, and orients readers toward the feature guides for extending the
workspace. It underscores how tools, function-call integrations, pipelines, actions,
and filters collectively enable structured automation when authoring code with
Open WebUI.

## Key Points
- Presents top-level navigation (Get Started, Features, Integrations) that anchors the
  rest of the documentation set for structured discovery.
- Outlines the extensibility model, linking to tool, function, pipe, action, and filter
  guides, clarifying how each unit contributes to customizable coding workflows.
- Emphasizes indexing aids such as search, category filters, and version switchers so
  contributors can retrieve relevant guidance quickly.

## Key Terms
- **Feature navigation** — menu and landing sections connecting to deep-dive guides.
- **Extensibility stack** — collective name for tools, functions, pipes, actions, filters.
- **Documentation index** — curated, cross-linked tree allowing quick reference for code
  authoring workflows.

## Implementation Notes
- Treat this portal as the canonical table of contents when curating additional
  knowledge artifacts.
- Align internal index structure in `docs/index.md` with the portal hierarchy for
  familiarity.
